# Ropey DVD Management System

<p style="font-style: italic;font-size: small;">"Application development coursework for creating an application to support the administration of renting and distributing DvDs of Ropey DvD's."</p>

Of course that's what the project started as, a simple assignment for our last year of undergrad. But we had no idea that the project was much more than a simple assignment, and that it would be a flurry of late hours, constant pull requests, work division, and, most importantly, a well working team effort.
